# Thoughts 
* I have tried to implement CNN and in this notebook I have worked with 3 models on FashionMNSIT Dataset.
  * One on **CPU**.In this I have just built a simple neural network.In this notebook(https://github.com/AkarshanGupta/Binary-and-Multiclass) I have written well detailed code on it
  * Second one **GPU**.In also there is simple neural network but only thing differs that it runs on **GPU** you can refer the same notebook which I have mentioned above
  * Third one **GPU**.In this I have built a Convulational Neural Netwrok using pytorch.I have tried built network[https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/] like this one.

* Note some code might because I ahve tried to run 3 models on **CPU and GPU** which made some code to throw error.You can also sort out it.
